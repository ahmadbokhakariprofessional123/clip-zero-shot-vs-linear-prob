# Assets

This folder contains figures and images used in the project documentation.

## Recommended files to add
- `results_table.png` — screenshot/export of the final Recall@1 / Recall@5 table
- `pipeline.png` — small diagram of the workflow (optional)
- `qualitative_examples.png` — example retrievals / predictions (optional)

## Notes
Keep images reasonably small (ideally < 1–2 MB each) so the repository stays lightweight.
